# Capstone: Restaurant Reservation System
This application was built for restaurant personnel so that they may keep track of customer reservations. It allows them to search, add, and seat reservations while also keeping track of open tables and completing reservations once finished.

Project Prompt:

You have been hired as a full stack developer at Periodic Tables, a startup that is creating a reservation system for fine dining restaurants. The Product Manager has already created 8 user stories for Periodic Tables, and another developer has already written the tests for each of the user stories.


## Technology

- Built with React.js, JSX, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Expressjs, Node.js, Git, Heroku, ElephantSQL, PostgreSQL, and Google Fonts

- This full stack application has built in unit, integration, and e2e tests. Each test is split up by user story. To install this application, you must:

	- Fork and Clone this repository.
	- Run cp ./back-end/.env.sample ./back-end/.env.
	- Update the ./back-end/.env file with the connection URL's to your ElephantSQL database instance.
	- Run cp ./front-end/.env.sample ./front-end/.env.
	- You should not need to make changes to the ./front-end/.env file unless you want to connect to a backend at a location other than http://localhost:5001
	- Run npm install to install project dependencies.
	- Run npm run start:dev to start your server in development mode
	- Additionally, tests for this application can be run for this application for each User Story by running npm run test:X where X is the user story number.
